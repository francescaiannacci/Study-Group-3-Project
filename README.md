# Study-Group-3-Project

As per every business student's aspiration, we only have one goal in life: becoming rich.
While we believe that LBS provides us with good foundations, we want to look the opportunity to network and talk with the real deal; actaul billionaires.
That's why we want to address the issue of how to find a billionaire and what to talk about in our netowrking session.
Our project was derived by looking at the factors that make up billionaires such as Industry, Demographics, Self-Made, Education, and Geography. We created a variety of vizuliations within these factors to gain a better understanding of billionaires. Having this better understanding of billionaires, we now know how to effectively position ourselves in the right enviroment to meet a billionaire and what to say to them when we do get the chance to network. Now that we know how to network with a billionaire, the last part of our project was running a regression to detail what factors are the most important to billionaire wealth so that we can now look to become a billionaire ourselves!

**Questions**

We want to see the relationships between the billionaires themselves and the factors/variables listed to infer the reasons behind their success and to predict our prosperity accordingly:

**Data**

Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset/data)

Dataset was collected from Kaggle, through toolbox.google.com.

This dataset contains statistics on the world's billionaires, including information about their businesses, industries, and personal details. It provides insights into the wealth distribution, business sectors, and demographics of billionaires worldwide.

**Statistical Techniques**

We are going to utilize different regression techniques (such as Linear Regression, LASSO Regression) to predict our likelihood of becoming a billionaire. 
We will utilize EDA techniques to build visualizations and correlation matrices to better understand the variables within the dataset.
